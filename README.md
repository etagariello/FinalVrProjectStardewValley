# FinalVrProjectStardewValley

This project was created by Elias Tagariello and Ivy Bowers, and is just for academic purposes. We are not claiming any money for this, it's just a fun idea. We took the main activities from Stardew Valley and implemented them to the best of our capabilites within 3 weeks. You can farm, feed animals, explore caves, go fishing with Willy, and interact with NPC's at the end scene. Hope you enjoy!
